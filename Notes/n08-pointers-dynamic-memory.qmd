# What is a pointer
Reference to a specific location within the memory allotted to the program by the OS.

These values can be stored in C. If you want to declare a pointer rather than a variable simply add an `*` to the variable declaration. (the data type is still required)

TODO: Maybe write about void pointer

declaration of different pointers
``` c
int * intPointer;
char * charPointer;
```

## Double pointers
It is clear  though that these pointers are also being stored in memory and as such must have pointers of their own. In the same way as before we simply add a `*` to the declaration.  
e.g.
``` c
int ** intDoublePointer
char ** charDoublePointer
```

# What is &/*

# Pointer arithmetic and arrays

# Dynamic memory
