    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nInstructions in this file are to be run in the same codespace based on 1711-introduction. Make sure to save your changes.\n\n\n\nAims\n\nUnderstand what a shell script is\nBe familiar making and executing shell scripts\n\n\n\nShell scripts\nShell scripts, often called bash scripts due to the prevalence of the bash script, are text file containing terminal commands that can be run to run all the commands. It is typical but not required in linux to give these files the .sh file extension. These are usually used to automate simple tasks.\nFirst make a a new file in the scripts directory called time.sh. In the file put these lines:\n#!/bin/bash\necho $(date)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo do this use the mkdir, cd, touch and nano commands\n\n\n\nCode breakdown\n\n#!/bin/bash tells the operating system where to find the shell to run the script. This must be the first string in the first line of the script to ensure portability and reliability.\necho is a command for outputting to the command line.\n$(date) is a value maintained by the system and accessible from the command line.\n\nWhen we wish to execute a program in our current directory we call it as a command by appending ./ to the name. This tells the operating system to look in the current directory for the program to run.\nTherefore In order to run the is script we run the command ./time.sh however at the moment that will give us this output:\n$ ./time.sh\nbash: ./time.sh: Permission denied\n\n\n\nWhy doesn’t the script run?\nThis is as, when creating a new file the default permissions for the file do not allow it to be executed. The current permissions of the file can be checked using the -l option for ls.\n$ ls -l\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 codespace codespace 13 Jul  7 09:28 time.sh\nThe part of this output that is relevant to this case is the string -rw-rw-rw-\n\nThe first character indicates any special permissions that the directory entry may have e.g. d for directory or l for symbolic link. In our case as time.sh is simply a file this is left empty.\nThe rest of the string represents the permissions for the file. This is split into 3 different categories for 3 different groups.\n\nThe three possible permissions are read(r), write(w) and execute(x). If the character is present in the string it means that the action is permitted for that group, otherwise the string will contain a -\nThis is repeated three times in the string, first for the owner of the file/directory, next the group assigned to the file/directory and finally all users\n\n\nSo in this case the file can be read and written by all users, but not executed, how can we change this?\n\n\nAltering file permissions.\nThe chmod command is used to alter the permissions of files. In this case we want to add executable permission to the file so we must run the command\nchmod +x time.sh\nOnce this is done, you can rerun the script and see the output.\n\n\nReminder of key steps to make a shell script\n\nMake file with .sh extension\nPut #!/bin/bash at the start of the file.\nChange the permissions so the file is executable.\n\n\n\nA more complex example:\nscripts/dataAnalysis1.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncat data/values* &gt; output.txt\nsed -i 's/\\s/\\n/g' output.txt \nsed -i '/^$/d' output.txt \nsort -no output.txt output.txt\nhead -n1 output.txt\ntail -n1 output.txt\nrm output.txt\nRun this script from the root of the git repo using ./scripts/dataAnalysis1.sh Then run each of the commands that the script will run individually and inspect the contents of output.txt to see what the command has done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGiven this script is using relative paths it will only work when it is being run from the the root of the repository.\nThis is as the working directory for the script is the same as the working directory where it is run.\n\n\nLets break down what this is doing:\n\nFirst line uses cat to output all files in directories starting data/values. It does this using the wildcard operator * to select all of these files. The output is then redirected to the file output.txt using &gt;.\noutput.txt now contains all the values, but not in the format we want. Therefore we use the stream editor sed to first split the values onto different lines using the pattern 's/\\s/\\n/g'. Then we remove any blank lines using the pattern /^$/d.\nNext we sort the file. The options -n specifies to sort numerically and -o allows for the specifying of an output file.\nhead -n1 and tail -n1 will output the first and last values respectively\nFinally rm removes out temporary file.\n\n\n\nAnother way\nFrom the root of the git repo run the command\ncat data/values* | sed 's/\\s/\\n/g' | sed '/^$/d' | sort -n | (head -n1 && tail -n1)\nThis condenses the whole of the previous script into a single line using pipes |. Pipes redirect output from one command to the next. This is still not really worth typing repeatedly so would likely be put in a script for reuse.\nThis script can be found in scripts/dataAnalysis2.sh\nThis does have a significant performance benefit though that can be seen by using the time command to measure the performance of each script. Try this yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember to save your changes to your Codespace."

It is a shortcut to fail out of the program if a value is not what it should be, when the program fails in this way it tells you exactly what condition failed and on which line.\n\nExample\nfailedAssertion.c\n#include &lt;assert.h&gt;\n\nint main()\n{\n    const int value = 5;\n    assert(value ==7);\n    return 0;\n}\nWhen executed this program will give the output (second line may vary depending on the machine the code is run on):\na.out: failedAssertion.c:6: main: Assertion `value ==7' failed.\nAborted (core dumped)\n\nOutput breakdown\n\na.out is the name of the executable\nfailedAssertion.c is the file that the assertion failed in\n:6 shows the line on which the execution failed\nmain is the function the assertion was in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile we treat assert as a function, it’s implementation in c is as a macro. This is not relevant to its use.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon uses\n\nPreconditions to a function\nIn this case assertions are used to ensure that the values passed to a function are valid. e.g.\n\nChecking that an index is within an expected range\nChecking that a pointer is not NULL (This will be fully explained later)\n\nIt is good practice to make the preconditions for a function clear when it is being defined, this is often in a header file.\n\n\nPostconditions for a function\nThis case uses assertions to make sure that the value a function is returning is valid - not really for user input"

    "text": "Looping\nIn looping control flow segments of code are executed repeatedly either based on a logical expression (while loop) or for a specific number of loops (for loop).\n\nWhile loop\nwhile(/*logical expression*/)\n{\n    // code to be run\n}\nThe logical expression is evaluated before each time the codeblock is run, making it possible to run the code 0 times.\n\nExample\naverage.c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main()\n{\n    int counter = 0;\n    float input = 0, total = 0; \n    printf(\"This is a program to calculate the average of positive values.\\n\")\n    printf(\"Once you have entered all your values enter a negative number to calculate the average.\\n\");\n    while (input != -1)\n    {\n        printf(\"Enter value:\");\n        scanf(\"%f\", &input);\n        if (input &lt; 0)\n        {\n            continue;\n        }\n        counter += 1;\n        total += input;\n    }\n    printf(\"Average is %f\\n\", total/(float)counter);\n}\n\nBreakdown\n\nMultiple variables of the same kind can be initialised in a single line when separated with commas.\n%f format specifier for floats\nThe continue keyword causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next one to start.\nAny control structure can be nested within another control structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor loop\nfor-test.c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) // Example loop to run 5 times.\n    {\n        // Code to be run\n        printf(\"(%d)\\n\", i);\n    }\n}\n\nBreakdown\nThe for loop control code has 3 key parts:\n\nVariable initialisation and assignment.\n\nIn this example:int i = 0;\nIt is typical in C (and may other programming languages) to start counting from 0, therefore it is often useful to start a loop control variable from 0.\nThe identifier i is used as a de-facto standard but can be renamed to improve code readability.\n\nCondition.\n\nIn this example: i &lt; 5\nThe code within the loop will run while this condition is true.\nAs such be careful if a mistake is made in the condition it may prohibit the code within the loop from running.\n\nUpdating the variable\n\nIn this example: `i++\n++ is called the increment operator and simply increases the value of a variable by one. It is simply a shortening of the code x = x+1.\n-- (the decrement operator) is often used in place of ++ for decreasing loops.\nCan also use i += &lt;val&gt; or i -= &lt;val&gt; to change variable by more than one without referencing it twice.\n\n\nYou should run for-test.c to check that this is all true. You can then change the parameters to see the values of i for which the loop will be run. Change the parameters so that it runs for different values:\n\nValues from 7 to 14\nOnly even numbers to 12\nDecreasing values from 4 to 0\n\n\n\nExample\nWhat do you think this block of code will do? Run it to find out! pattern.c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main()\n{\n    for(int i = 1; i &lt; 8; i++)\n    {\n        for(int j = 0; j &lt; i; j++)\n        {\n            printf(\"*\");\n        }\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n}\n\nNotes\n\nNested for loops are a common pattern. You have to make sure to use different variables for the inner and outer loops.\nIn this case the inner loop is dependent on the outer loop as the condition for the inner loop is based on the control value of the outer loop\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: Break and continue"
