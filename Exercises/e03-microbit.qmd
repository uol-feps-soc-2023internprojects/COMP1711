# Part 1 - Displaying images
This is a basic program to display an image.

``` c
#include "MicroBit.h"

// The Micro:bit control object
MicroBit uBit;

// Out main function, run at startup
int main() 
{
    

    
    // Loop forever
    while( true ) 
    {
        // loop is empty as we are not repeating anything
    }

    // Will never return, but here so the compiler is happy :)
    return 0;
}
```
